In my day job as an Autosys developer, I have to create new JILs every other day or have to review/QA JILs created by other developers. I mostly use Notepad++ to create and read JILs, however Notepad++ does not have an inbuilt syntax highlighting language option. Without one it is too difficult to write a JIL and understand it and find any syntax error, Just like any other programming language.

I did some online research to find some good plugins , however the most I found did not suit my needs, which is the code should look neat and simple with effective syntax color higlighting, and yes, the font must be the 'courier new'.

So I decided to create one with the help of already existing templates.

Link to download the plugin file.

Below is the screencast which should help you how to import this plugin and start using it.
